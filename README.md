## Description
{1. A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 

2. Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

## Experimental Procedure:

1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

2. Read and explore the given dataset.

3. Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

4. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

5. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.

6. Supervised or Unsupervised Learning

6. From your insights provide a conclusion and recommendation.
 

## Research Question:

1.  create a supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog. 

2. Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
